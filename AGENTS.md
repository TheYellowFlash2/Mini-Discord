# Repository Agent Rules

1. When the user asks for a code/content modification, complete the change, then commit and push it to `origin/main` in the same turn.
2. Use clear, specific commit messages that describe the implemented change.
3. Do not rewrite history (`--amend`, force-push) unless the user explicitly requests it.
